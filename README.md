**Professional Portfolio [IN PROGRESS]**   -  
Welcome to my professional portfolio, showcasing my proficiency in key programming languages and frameworks such as APIs, React, JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), CSS, and HTML.

**Objective**   -  
The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my expertise in frontend development and present a collection of projects that I have worked on. By creating this portfolio, I aim to provide potential employers with a comprehensive overview of my skills and abilities.

**Process**   -  
To make my portfolio stand out, I decided to incorporate an element that resonates with my personal interests: space and physics. Initially, I wanted to animate a black hole using pure CSS, but I soon discovered the power of the THREE.js library, which enabled me to create a visually stunning solar system with rings. Within this interactive environment, I included small icons representing the technologies and programming languages that I utilize in my projects and find particularly interesting.

**PSA (Public Service Announcement)**   -  
Please note that this project is still a work in progress. Currently, I have written approximately 2000 lines of code, primarily in TypeScript.

**Current Status**   -  
While there is more content to be added, I am continuously improving and refining my portfolio. Despite the aforementioned technical issues, it remains a compelling showcase of my skills and serves as a testament to my dedication and expertise.
